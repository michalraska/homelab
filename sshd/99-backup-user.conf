# SSH configuration for Synology Active Backup for Business
# Extends keep-alive timeout for the backup user to prevent disconnects during long transfers
#
# Default SSH settings (ClientAliveInterval 300, ClientAliveCountMax 2) cause
# timeouts after ~10 minutes of inactivity, which interrupts large backup/restore operations.
#
# This configuration allows up to 60 minutes (60 x 60 seconds) without response.
#
# Install: sudo cp 99-backup-user.conf /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/
# Reload:  sudo systemctl restart ssh
