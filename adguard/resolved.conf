# systemd-resolved configuration for AdGuard Home
# Copy this file to /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/adguardhome.conf
#
# This configuration:
# - Routes all DNS queries to AdGuard Home on localhost
# - Disables the local stub DNS listener (127.0.0.53) to avoid port conflicts
#
# After copying, run:
#   sudo mv /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.backup
#   sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
#   sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
